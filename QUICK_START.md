# Quick Start Guide - Ultra-Painless Mac Transfer

## Pre-Flight Checklist (1 minute)

### On Your Current Mac
1. ✅ **Already done**: Configs backed up to this repo
2. ✅ **Already done**: Essential packages documented
3. **Push to GitHub** (if not done):
   ```bash
   git add . && git commit -m "Complete Mac work transfer backup" && git push
   ```

### On Your New Mac
1. **Install basic tools** (copy-paste this one command):
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)" && brew install git
   ```

## One-Command Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shootdaj/mac-work-transfer.git && cd mac-work-transfer && ./scripts/setup-final.sh
```

That's it! The script will:
- ✅ Install everything automatically that can be automated  
- ⏸️ Pause when manual apps need to be installed
- ✅ Continue once you're ready
- 📊 Show a progress bar and final summary

## What Makes This Painless

### 🛡️ **Ultra-Robust**
- Never crashes - continues on errors
- Tries batch install, falls back to individual packages
- Backs up existing configs before overwriting
- Shows exactly what succeeded/failed

### 🎯 **Zero Guesswork**
- Progress bar shows exactly where you are
- Clear instructions for each step
- Direct download links for manual apps
- Color-coded success/failure messages

### 📱 **Mobile-Friendly Manual Steps**
All manual app downloads have direct links you can text yourself:
- AltTab: https://alt-tab-macos.netlify.app
- Raycast: https://raycast.com
- Warp: https://warp.dev
- etc.

### 🔄 **Graceful Recovery**
- If something fails, see `MANUAL_RECOVERY.md`
- Each step documented separately
- Can run individual scripts if needed

## Expected Timeline
- **Automated portion**: 10-15 minutes
- **Manual app installs**: 10-20 minutes (while script waits)
- **Total time**: ~30 minutes hands-on

## Pro Tips
1. **Download manual apps in parallel** while script runs other tasks
2. **Use Raycast first** - it makes everything else faster
3. **Restart apps after setup** - configs need fresh start
4. **Generate SSH keys last** - need them for GitHub/work
